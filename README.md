# stock-analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
  
### Purpose
  The purpose of the assignment was to refactor the VBA code done in the module to determine if we make a noticable improvement to the speed of the program.  This was done through VBA script in Excel as well as using Excel to store the stock data we used.  

## Stock-analysis Analysis Results
  The results showed that when comparing the two years, the returns from 2017 to 2018 fell by quite a large margin.

  They also showed that the stocks that stayed in the positive for returns came back with a much lower return when compared with the previous year. When comparing the previous codes, the refactored code ran faster than the previously created code from the module for both years.
  
## Stock-analysis Analysis Summary
  When determining the advantages of refactoring the original code, it's clear that the refactored code ran much faster than the old code. It also has the drawback of being more complicated to code and prone to running into unforseen errors as I found out myself when refactoring. When looking at this specific instance, it was clearly better to refactor the code so that the run time would significantly speed up even with the cost of more complex code.
